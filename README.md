# [VocabFlashcards][appLink]

AngularJS client that helps generate flashcards from a given list of words (separated by a newline in .txt file). Definitions are obtained from the backend which communicates with a chosen dictionary, the application is purely for educational purposes and is **not** for any sort of commercial uses. The target audience are people who would like to learn new words (not memorize them), be it for SAT, GRE, GMAT, CAT or any other test/examination or because they simply want to expand their vocabulary.

#### Todo

###### Needed right away
- Cleaner theme
- Write tests (unit and integration)
- Add new dictionaries (currently supports vocabulary.com - definitions are obtained from the backend)
 
###### Nothing urgent
* Integrate social media so that people can share word lists

#### Contribution
  - If you've created a new feature, please add appropriate unit tests.
  - If you're customizing the design/theme, please attach screenshots.
  - Fork and perform a pull request when ready; please **make sure that all the tests pass** before making a pull request.
